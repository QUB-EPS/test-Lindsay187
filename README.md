# Simple Budget Tracker Project

## Welcome to Your Budget Adventure!

Hello, budding web developers! Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey to create your very own Simple Budget Tracker? This project will guide you through building a web application where users can manage their finances, track income and expenses, and visualize their budget. By the end of this adventure, you'll have a shiny new web app, sharpened coding skills, and a project you can proudly showcase. Let's get started!

## Overall Project Overview

### Objective

Create a Simple Budget Tracker web application that allows users to:

- Add income and expenses with descriptions and amounts.
- View a list of all transactions.
- Edit and delete entries.
- Calculate total income, expenses, and remaining budget.
- Visualize spending patterns with simple charts.
- Authenticate: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.

### Technology Stack
You will use Python and Flask for the back end, and HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the front end. You will use SQLite to store data.

##  Overall Project Features and Requirements

Here's a step-by-step guide to the features your application should include.  Let's dive into the details!

1. Setting Up the Project Environment
- Install Python and Flask: Ensure Python and Git are installed on your system.  Prepare a virtual environment then install Flask and any other packages you may need. (Pro tip: double-check versions and dependencies!)
- Set up a new Flask project: Create a directory for your project and initialize it as a Flask app.
- Git Initialization: Initialize a Git repository and make your first commit. (Tip: get into the habit of committing often to capture your progress!)
- Create Basic HTML Templates: Set up basic HTML templates for your application using a template engine like Jinja2.

2. User Interface Design
- Design a Responsive UI: Use HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly and responsive interface.
  - Implement Bootstrap or another CSS framework for quick styling. (Tip: Keep it simple and intuitive!)
- Create Transaction Forms: Design forms for adding income and expense entries.
  - Each transaction should include a description, amount, category and type (income or expense).
3. Viewing Transactions
- Display Transactions: List all transactions in a tabular format.
  - Use dynamic table generation with Flask templates. (Tip: Make your data easy to read!)
- Implement Sorting and Filtering: Allow users to sort and filter transactions by date, type, or amount.
4. Adding Transactions
- Handle Form Submission: Process form data on the server side.
  - Save transaction data in a database (use SQLite for simplicity).
- Validate Input: Ensure all required fields are filled and handle form validation. (Tip: Validations save you from a world of debugging pain!)
5. Editing and Deleting Transactions
- Edit Transactions: Allow users to update transaction details.
- Implement an edit form pre-filled with existing transaction data.
- Delete Transactions: Provide a way to delete transactions.
  - Include confirmation dialogs for delete actions to prevent accidental deletions.
6. Calculating and Displaying Totals
- Calculate Totals: Compute total income, total expenses, and remaining budget.
  - Update totals dynamically as transactions are added, edited, or deleted.
- Display Totals: Show totals prominently on the page for easy viewing. (Tip: Help users understand their financial status at a glance!)
7. Visualizing Budget Data
- Implement Charts: Use a library like Chart.js to create visual representations of budget data.
  - Create pie charts or bar graphs to display spending patterns.
- Interactive Visuals: Allow users to interact with charts (e.g., hover for details).
8. Implementing User Authentication
- User Registration: Create a registration form to allow users to sign up with a username and password.
  - Use Flask extensions like `Flask-WTF` for form handling and validation.
  - Securely store passwords using a library like `Werkzeug` for hashing.
- User Login: Implement a login form that authenticates users.
  - Use session management to keep users logged in across pages.
  - Display user-specific data once logged in.
- User Logout: Provide functionality for users to log out.
  - Clear session data on logout.


### Bonus Features (Optional Enhancements)
Unleash your creativity and add these features as stretch goals!
- Categories: Add categories for transactions (e.g., Food, Travel, Bills) and allow filtering by category.
- Monthly Reports: Generate monthly summaries of income and expenses.
- Export/Import: Allow users to export their data to a CSV file or import data from one.
- Notifications: Implement alerts for when users exceed budget limits.


## Version Control and Project Management
- Use Git for Version Control: Regularly commit your changes and use meaningful commit messages. (Tip: Think of each commit as a snapshot of your project's journey!)
- Branching Strategy: Use branches for developing new features and merge changes into the main branch once complete.
- Track Your Progress: Utilize GitLab to track progress and document your development journey.
- Share it with me! Make sure to invite/add me to your repository as a developer so I can have a look at your commits and code.

## Project Assessment Strategy

This project is divided into two submissions, to focus mastery of each aspect of modern web application development independently.  Part 1 emphasizes the importance of good front end design and using Git effectively, while Part 2 deepens understanding of back-end development, databases and authentication.  This approach helps build a solid foundation for developing full-stack applications.  Below is a detailed plan for each part of the assessment, including a breakdown of the tasks, learning objectives and assessment criteria.
